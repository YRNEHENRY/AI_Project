The two players will each start in an opposite corner of the board.

In turn, each player will advance in the chessboard and take a square. Be careful, a player will not be able to cross an opponent's square.
If a part of the chessboard is no longer accessible by the opponent, he will take the player's color.
The game ends when each square of the board is taken.
